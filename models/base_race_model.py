"""
base_race_model.py - Core Race Simulation Engine

This module contains the fundamental race simulation logic that calculates
qualifying positions, race lap times, incidents, and final race results based
on driver skills, car performance, track characteristics, and weather conditions.

Key Components:
- RaceSimulator class: Main simulation engine for qualifying and race
- DriverRaceResult dataclass: Stores final race result for each driver
- RaceIncident enum: Types of incidents (mechanical, collision, puncture, etc.)
- Lap time calculations with driver, car, track, and weather factors

Simulation Logic:
- Qualifying: Calculates grid positions based on driver skill and car performance
- Race: Simulates lap-by-lap performance with tire degradation and incidents
- Incident simulation: Random events (DNFs, penalties, mechanical failures)

Integration:
- Extended by advanced_race_model.py for real data integration
- Used by app.py to run complete race simulations
- References driver_data, team_data, and track_data for attributes
